# Animal Family Backend

A Go backend API for managing animal care tasks, enclosures, and related data.

**Frontend Repository:** [animal-family-web](https://github.com/whitallee/animal-family-web)

> **Note:** This is currently in Pre-Alpha. If you'd like to collaborate, please reach out! Find my contact info on [whitcodes.dev/contact](https://whitcodes.dev/contact).

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.26 or later
- Docker (for the local Postgres) or any PostgreSQL
- [Doppler CLI](https://docs.doppler.com/docs/install-cli) (or a `.env` file)
- Make (optional, for using Makefile commands)

## Running Locally

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/whitallee/animal-family-backend.git
cd animal-family-backend
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Configuration is read from the process environment. The default is
[Doppler](https://www.doppler.com): `make run`, `make migrate-up` and friends
run under `doppler run --`, so log in and link the repo once:

```bash
doppler login
doppler setup   # project: backend, config: dev
```

**Without Doppler**, copy `.env.example` to `.env`, fill in real values, and
pass `ENV_FILE` to any make target:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
make run ENV_FILE=.env
```

See `.env.example` for the full list of variables and their defaults.

### 3. Set Up Database

Run a local Postgres in Docker (data persists in a named volume):

```bash
make db-up
```

Then set `DB_HOST=localhost`, `DB_PORT=5432`, `DB_USER=postgres`,
`DB_PASSWORD=postgres`, `DB_NAME=brindl_dev` and `DB_SSL_MODE=disable` in your
Doppler `dev` config (or `.env`). Any other Postgres works too. Don't point
`dev` at a database you care about: `make migrate-down` drops tables.

### 4. Run Migrations

Run database migrations and seed data:

```bash
make migrate-up
make seed
```

### 5. Build and Run

Using Make:

```bash
make run
```

Or manually, with the variables already in your environment:

```bash
go build -o bin/animal-family-backend cmd/main.go
ENVIRONMENT=development doppler run -- ./bin/animal-family-backend
```

The API server will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

### 6. Install Git Hooks (one-time)

```bash
make install-hooks
```

Runs `gofmt` + `go vet` before each commit.

## Available Make Commands

- `make build` - Build the application
- `make run` - Build and run the application (under Doppler; add `ENV_FILE=.env` to use a file)
- `make test` - Run all tests (needs no database or secrets)
- `make db-up` / `make db-down` / `make db-psql` - Start, stop, or open a shell in the local Postgres container
- `make migrate-up` - Run database migrations and seed data
- `make migrate-down` - Rollback database migrations
- `make seed` - Seed the database with initial data
- `make migration <name>` - Create a new migration file
- `make install-hooks` - Install git hooks (gofmt + go vet before each commit)
- `make spec` - Regenerate the v2 OpenAPI contract (`docs/openapi.json`)
- `make spec-check` - Verify the committed contract matches the code

## API Versions

`/api/v1` is the original API. `/api/v2` is a smaller, REST-conventional
replacement being built alongside it — plural collections, IDs in the path, and
no separate `/admin/*` route tree. Both are served; v1 will be retired once the
frontend has fully migrated.

The v2 contract is generated from annotations on the handlers into
[`docs/openapi.json`](docs/openapi.json), which is also served at
`GET /openapi.json`. The frontend generates its API client from it.

## Project Structure

- `cmd/` - Application entry points (main.go, api/, migrate/)
- `config/` - Configuration management
- `db/` - Database connection and setup
- `service/` - Business logic and route handlers
- `types/` - Type definitions
- `utils/` - Utility functions
